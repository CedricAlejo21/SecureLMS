The system includes proper error handling, logging, and follows OWASP authentication guidelines. All sensitive operations are properly validated and sanitized.`,

    'Input Validation and Sanitization': `This assignment demonstrates comprehensive input validation and sanitization techniques:

1. Server-side Validation: Implemented robust validation using express-validator
2. XSS Prevention: Applied HTML encoding and Content Security Policy headers
3. SQL Injection Prevention: Used parameterized queries and input sanitization
4. File Upload Security: Validated file types, sizes, and implemented virus scanning
5. Data Type Validation: Enforced strict data type checking for all inputs

The solution includes both client-side and server-side validation with proper error messaging and security logging.`,

    'Security Code Review Assignment': `Performed a thorough security code review of the provided application:

VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED:
1. SQL Injection in user authentication (Line 45-52)
2. Cross-Site Scripting in comment display (Line 128)
3. Insecure Direct Object References in file access (Line 203)
4. Missing CSRF protection on state-changing operations
5. Weak session management with predictable session IDs

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement parameterized queries for database operations
- Add input sanitization and output encoding
- Implement proper access controls with authorization checks
- Add CSRF tokens to all forms
- Use cryptographically secure random session generation

Detailed remediation steps and code examples are provided in the attached report.`,

    'Web Application Security Testing': `Conducted comprehensive security testing using multiple methodologies:

TESTING APPROACH:
1. Automated Scanning: Used OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for vulnerability discovery
2. Manual Testing: Performed manual penetration testing for business logic flaws
3. Code Analysis: Static analysis using SonarQube and manual code review
4. Authentication Testing: Tested for authentication bypass and session management issues

FINDINGS:
- 3 High-severity vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication Bypass)
- 5 Medium-severity issues (CSRF, Information Disclosure, Weak Encryption)
- 8 Low-severity findings (Missing Security Headers, Verbose Error Messages)

All findings include proof-of-concept exploits, risk ratings, and detailed remediation guidance.`,
