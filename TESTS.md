# SecureLMS Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for SecureLMS, focusing on security requirements from CHECKLIST.md and ensuring robust functionality testing.

## Testing Approach
- **Primary Focus**: Integration Testing (tests real request/response flows)
- **Secondary Focus**: Unit Testing (for complex business logic)
- **End-to-End Testing**: NO - Integration tests provide sufficient coverage for our security-focused requirements
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + Supertest for API testing

## Testing Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality Integration Tests
**Goal**: Ensure core application functionality works correctly

#### 1.1 Authentication Foundation (tests/integration/01-auth/)
- [x] **1.1.1** User registration with valid data
- [x] **1.1.2** User login with valid credentials
- [x] **1.1.3** JWT token generation and validation
- [x] **1.1.4** Protected route access with valid token
- [x] **1.1.5** Protected route rejection without token

#### 1.2 Basic CRUD Operations (tests/integration/02-basic-functionality/)
- [x] **1.2.1** Course creation by instructor
- [x] **1.2.2** Course listing and retrieval
- [x] **1.2.3** Student enrollment in courses
- [ ] **1.2.4** Assignment creation by instructor
- [ ] **1.2.5** Assignment submission by student
- [ ] **1.2.6** Grade assignment by instructor
- [ ] **1.2.7** User profile management

### Phase 2: Security Features Integration Tests
**Goal**: Validate all CHECKLIST.md security requirements

#### 2.1 Authentication Security (tests/integration/03-security-features/auth-security.test.js)
Based on CHECKLIST.md sections 2.1.x:

- [ ] **2.1.1** Require authentication for all protected pages/resources *(CHECKLIST 2.1.1)*
- [ ] **2.1.2** Authentication controls fail securely *(CHECKLIST 2.1.2)*
- [ ] **2.1.3** Only cryptographically strong hashed passwords stored *(CHECKLIST 2.1.3)*
- [ ] **2.1.4** Generic authentication failure responses *(CHECKLIST 2.1.4)*
- [ ] **2.1.5** Password complexity requirements enforcement *(CHECKLIST 2.1.5)*
- [ ] **2.1.6** Password length requirements enforcement *(CHECKLIST 2.1.6)*
- [ ] **2.1.8** Account lockout after failed attempts *(CHECKLIST 2.1.8)*
- [ ] **2.1.10** Password re-use prevention *(CHECKLIST 2.1.10)*
- [ ] **2.1.11** Password age enforcement (1 day minimum) *(CHECKLIST 2.1.11)*
- [ ] **2.1.12** Last login attempt reporting *(CHECKLIST 2.1.12)*
- [ ] **2.1.13** Re-authentication for critical operations *(CHECKLIST 2.1.13)*

#### 2.2 Authorization/Access Control (tests/integration/03-security-features/authorization.test.js)
Based on CHECKLIST.md sections 2.2.x:

- [ ] **2.2.1** Single site-wide authorization component *(CHECKLIST 2.2.1)*
- [ ] **2.2.2** Access controls fail securely *(CHECKLIST 2.2.2)*
- [ ] **2.2.3** Business rule compliance enforcement *(CHECKLIST 2.2.3)*
- [ ] **2.2.4** Role-based access control (Admin/Instructor/Student)
- [ ] **2.2.5** Cross-role access prevention
- [ ] **2.2.6** Resource ownership validation

#### 2.3 Data Validation (tests/integration/03-security-features/validation.test.js)
Based on CHECKLIST.md sections 2.3.x:

- [ ] **2.3.1** Input rejection on validation failures *(CHECKLIST 2.3.1)*
- [ ] **2.3.2** Data range validation *(CHECKLIST 2.3.2)*
- [ ] **2.3.3** Data length validation *(CHECKLIST 2.3.3)*
- [ ] **2.3.4** NoSQL injection prevention
- [ ] **2.3.5** XSS prevention through input validation

#### 2.4 Error Handling and Logging (tests/integration/03-security-features/logging.test.js)
Based on CHECKLIST.md sections 2.4.x:

- [ ] **2.4.1** No debugging/stack trace in error responses *(CHECKLIST 2.4.1)*
- [ ] **2.4.2** Generic error messages and custom error pages *(CHECKLIST 2.4.2)*
- [ ] **2.4.3** Success and failure logging for security events *(CHECKLIST 2.4.3)*
- [ ] **2.4.4** Restricted log access to administrators *(CHECKLIST 2.4.4)*
- [ ] **2.4.5** Input validation failure logging *(CHECKLIST 2.4.5)*
- [ ] **2.4.6** Authentication attempt logging *(CHECKLIST 2.4.6)*
- [ ] **2.4.7** Access control failure logging *(CHECKLIST 2.4.7)*

### Phase 3: Edge Cases and Error Handling (tests/integration/04-edge-cases/)
- [ ] **3.1** Malformed request handling
- [ ] **3.2** Rate limiting enforcement (Create dedicated rate limiting test suite)
- [ ] **3.3** Database connection failure scenarios
- [ ] **3.4** Invalid JWT token scenarios

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Dependencies
- Jest (already installed)
- Supertest (already installed)
- MongoDB Memory Server (for isolated testing)
- Test database configuration

### Test Database Strategy
- Use separate test database: `mongodb://localhost:27017/lms_secure_test`
- Reset database state before each test suite
- Use transaction rollbacks where possible

### Authentication Test Strategy
- Create test users for each role (Admin, Instructor, Student)
- Generate test JWT tokens
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm test -- tests/integration/01-auth/
npm test -- tests/integration/02-basic-functionality/
npm test -- tests/integration/03-security-features/

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Coverage Goals
- **Minimum**: 80% code coverage
- **Target**: 90%+ coverage for security-critical components
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Authentication middleware
  - Authorization middleware
  - Input validation
  - Audit logging

## Success Criteria
- All CHECKLIST.md requirements have corresponding tests
- All tests pass consistently
- Security vulnerabilities are caught by tests
- Regression testing prevents security feature breakage

## Notes
- Tests should be independent and idempotent
- Use descriptive test names that map to requirements
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Security tests should verify both functionality and failure scenarios
- Each test should clean up after itself

---

**Why No End-to-End Testing?**
- Integration tests provide sufficient coverage for API endpoints
- Security requirements focus on server-side validation
- Frontend security is minimal (JWT handling, basic validation)
- Integration tests are faster and more maintainable
- Focus on backend security where real vulnerabilities exist
